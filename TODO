 * support migrations
   instances need to be notified someway of begin/end of a migration and
   be aware of both continua (before and after the migration)
   during this period the instance should move the items not owned anymore,
   use the new continuum for all set requests , use the new continuum for all
   get and delete requests but revert to the old continuum in case those fails
   because of the item not found.
   At the end of a migration the old continuum can be disposed

 * parallelize eviction
   evict commands are very small and can be handled quickly but now it's
   only one thread making this job and it might be not enough in case of
   a big number of delete requests for keys not owned by the
   receiving instance)

 * support expiration of keys
