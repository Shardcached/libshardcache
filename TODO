 * use asynchronous i/o when sending messages to peers (all functions in messaging.c)

 * make asynchronous versions of shardcache_get() and shardcache_set()
   which provide/send data in chunks while available by calling some callback
   passed as argument

 * parallelize eviction
   evict commands are very small and can be handled quickly but now it's
   only one thread making this job and it might be not enough in case of
   a big number of delete requests for keys not owned by the
   receiving instance)

 * parallelize migrations
