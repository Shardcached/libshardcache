Basic Installation
==================

Shipped makefiles should work on most unix systems.
Note that libshardcache requires to be built on a system supporting uint64_t
otherwise it won't compile.

The simplest way to compile libshardcache is:
  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `make' to build the package. Note that this will also download and build
     all the dependencies.
     The built package will statically link its dependencies so there is no
     need to install those system-wide

  2. Optionally, type `make test' to compile and run run all the unit tests
     that come with the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the library and include files

  4. Type `make install_utils' to install the cmdline utilities

  5. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also removes the
     dependencies built in the `./deps' directory and clean both
     the `./deps/.incs' and `./deps/.libs' directories.

Installation Names
==================

By default, `make install' installs the built libraries under `/usr/local/lib`
and the publicinclude files under `/usr/local/include'. 
`make install_utils' will install the cmdline utils under `/usr/local/bin'.

    You can specify a prefix other than `/usr/local' by defining the environment
variable `SHARDCACHE_INSTALL_PREFIX'.

    You can override single installation directories by defining the environment
variables SHARDCACHE_INSTALL_LIBDIR, SHARDCACHE_INSTALL_INCDIR and
SHARDCACHE_INSTALL_BINDIR
